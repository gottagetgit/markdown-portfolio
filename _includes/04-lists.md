Some of my favorite things.

* Raindrops on roses
  * A raindrop is water that has fallen one or two miles from the sky :smile:
* Whiskers on kittens
  * I'm more of a dog person :+1:
* Schnitzel with noodles
  * Never had it with noodles, but a good schnitzel can't be beat :heart:
* Snowflakes that stay on my nose and eyelashes
  * The problem with snow is that you often get more than you wanted :snowflake:
