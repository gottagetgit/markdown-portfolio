_I'm not a guy who likes to brag._

But I do feel __blessed__ with how the first 40+ years of my life have gone so far.

I've met some amazing people. Worked at some wonderful places. Learned a lot. Been able to turn around and teach what I know. I'd like to think of myself as generous, but I also know there is room to be more generous.
